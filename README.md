Neural Networks Coursework

This repository serves as a collection of my assignments and projects for my Neural Networks university course. Each project focuses on a different architecture or fundamental concept of Machine Learning.

Project 1: Logistic Regression as a Single-Layer Perceptron

Objective

To implement a fundamental classifier using TensorFlow to understand how a single neuron makes decisions. Technical Breakdown

Architecture: 1 Input Layer (2 features) → 1 Output Neuron.

Activation: Sigmoid (to produce a probability between 0 and 1).

Optimization: Adam optimizer and Binary Cross-Entropy loss.

Concepts Demonstrated: Weights, Gradients, and Linear Decision Boundaries.
Visual Results

The model learns to draw a line (Decision Boundary) that separates two classes of data. As the Gradient Descent progresses, the training loss decreases and accuracy increases. Environment & Setup

All projects in this repo are designed to be run in Google Colab to avoid local version conflicts (specifically with Python 3.14+).

Open Google Colab.

Upload the .py or .ipynb file from this repo.

Run all cells to see the training process and visualizations.
